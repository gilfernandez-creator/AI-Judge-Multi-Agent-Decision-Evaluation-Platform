# AI-Judge-Multi-Agent-Decision-Evaluation-Platform
AI Judge is a multi-agent decision support system that evaluates scenarios submitted by users and provides a final recommendation. The platform leverages multiple AI agents, each analyzing the input independently, and a central Judge component that consolidates their outputs, assesses risks, and produces a decision: ACCEPT, REJECT, or ESCALATE.
